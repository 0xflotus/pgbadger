2012-08-21 - version 2.0

This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous versions. Options
-p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs generation are enabled by default now.
The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to specify an
incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a single log file
      and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous run. Useful if you have a log
      rotation not sync with your pgbadger run. For exemple you can run somthing like this:

	pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
	    -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries diplayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or hide a nice 
      SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.
