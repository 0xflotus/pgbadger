2012-05-04 - version to 1.0

  First public release of pgBadger.

    New feature:

	- Add graph of ckeckpoint Wal files usage (added, removed, recycled).
	- Add --image-format to allow the change of the default png image
	  format to jpeg.
	- Allow download of all pie graphics as images.
 	- Add --pie-limit to sum all data lower than this percentage limit to
	  avoid label overlap.
 	- Allow download of graphics as PNG images.
	- Replace GD::Graph by the Flotr2 javascript library to draw graphics.
	  Patch by Guillaume Lelarge
	- Add pie graphs for session, database, user and host. Add a --quiet
	  option to remove debug output and --progress to show a progress bar
	  during log parsing
	- Add pie graph for Queries by type.
	- Add graph for checkpoint write buffer per hours
	- Allow log parsing without any log_line_prefix and extend it to be
	  defined by the user. Custom log_line prefix can be parsed using user
	  defined regex with command line option --regex-db and --regex-user.
	  For exemple the default regex of pgbadger to parse user and db name
	  from log_line_prefix can be written like this:
		pgbadger -l mylogfile.log  --regex-user="user=([^,]*)," \
			--regex-db="db=([^,]*)"
	- Separe log_line_prefix from log level part in the parser to extend
	  log_line_prefix parsing
	- If there is just one argument, assume it is the logfile and use
	  default value for all other parameters
	- Add autodetection of log format (syslog or stderr) if none is given
	  with option -f
	- Add --outfile option to dump output to a file instead of stdout.
	  Default filename is out.html or out.txt following the output format.
	  To dump to stdout set filename to -
	- Add --version command line option to show current pgbadger version.

    Bug fix:

	- Rearrange x and y axis
	- Fix legend opacity on graphics
	- Rearrange Overall stats view
	- Add more "normalization" on errors messages

	- Force quiet mode when --progress is used
	- Fix per sessions graphs
	- Fix sort order of days/hours into hours array
	- Fix sort order of days into graphics
	- Remove display of locks, sessions and connections statistics when none
	  are available
