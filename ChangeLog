2012-07-15 - version 1.2

This version adds some reports and fixes a major issue in log parser. Every one 
should upgrade.

	- Rewrite this changelog to be human readable.
	- Add -v | --verbose to enable debug mode. It is now disable by default
	- Add hourly report of checkpoint warning when checkpoints are occuring
	  too frequently, it will display the hourly count and the average
	  occuring time.
	- Add new report that sums the messages by log types. The report shows
	  the number of messages of each log type, and a percentage. It also
	  displays a pie graph. Patch by Guillaume Lelarge.
	- Add missing pie graph on locks by type report.
	- Format pie mouse track to display values only.
	- Fix graph download button id on new connection graph.
	- Add trackFormatter to flotr2 line graphs to show current x/y values.
	- Fix issue on per minute minimum value.
	- Add a note about Windows Os and zcat as well as a more general note
	  about using compressed log file in other format than gzip.
	- Complete rewrite of the log parser to handle unordered log lines.
	  Data are now stored by pid before and added to the global statistics
	  at end. Error report now include full details, statements, contexts
	  and hints when available. Deadlock are also fully reported with the
	  concerned queries.
	- Fix miss handling of multi lines queries on syslog.
	- Add -a|--average option to configure the per minutes average interval
	  for queries and connexions. If you want the average to be calculated
	  each minutes instead of the 5 per default, use --average 1 or for the
	  default --average 5. If you want average per hour set it to 60.
	- Add hourly statistics of connections and sessions as well as a chart
	  about the number of connection per second (5 minutes average).
	- Allow OTHERS type of queries lower than 2% to be include in the sum of
	  types < 2%.
	- Add autodetection of syslog ident name if different than the default
	  "postgres" and that there is just one ident name in the log.
	- Remove syslog replacement of tabulation by #011 still visible when
	  there was multiple tabulation.
	- Fix autodetection of log format syslog with single-digit day number
	  in date.
	- Add ChangeLog to MANIFEST and change URI in html footer.
	- Check pgBadger compatibility with Windows Oses. Run perfectly.

2012-05-04 - version to 1.0

  First public release of pgBadger.

    New feature:

	- Add graph of ckeckpoint Wal files usage (added, removed, recycled).
	- Add --image-format to allow the change of the default png image
	  format to jpeg.
	- Allow download of all pie graphics as images.
 	- Add --pie-limit to sum all data lower than this percentage limit to
	  avoid label overlap.
 	- Allow download of graphics as PNG images.
	- Replace GD::Graph by the Flotr2 javascript library to draw graphics.
	  Patch by Guillaume Lelarge

	  during log parsing
	- Add pie graph for Queries by type.

	- Allow log parsing without any log_line_prefix and extend it to be
	  defined by the user. Custom log_line prefix can be parsed using user
	  defined regex with command line option --regex-db and --regex-user.
	  For exemple the default regex of pgbadger to parse user and db name
	  from log_line_prefix can be written like this:
		pgbadger -l mylogfile.log  --regex-user="user=([^,]*)," \
			--regex-db="db=([^,]*)"

	  log_line_prefix parsing
	- If there is just one argument, assume it is the logfile and use
	  default value for all other parameters
	- Add autodetection of log format (syslog or stderr) if none is given
	  with option -f
	- Add --outfile option to dump output to a file instead of stdout.
	  Default filename is out.html or out.txt following the output format.
	  To dump to stdout set filename to -
	- Add --version command line option to show current pgbadger version.

    Bug fix:

	- Rearrange x and y axis
	- Fix legend opacity on graphics
	- Rearrange Overall stats view
	- Add more "normalization" on errors messages
	- Fix samples error with normalyzed error instead of real error message
	- Fix an other average size of temporary file decimal limit
	- Force quiet mode when --progress is used
	- Fix per sessions graphs
	- Fix sort order of days/hours into hours array
	- Fix sort order of days into graphics
	- Remove display of locks, sessions and connections statistics when none
	  are available
	- Fix display of empty column of checkpoint when no checkpoint was found
